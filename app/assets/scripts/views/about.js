                    <p>1.1. billion people still lack access to electricity across the world. Off-grid technologies and approaches are emerging as part of the solutions to serve the energy poor, but lack of data and information on the market potential remains a major constraint and impediment. As a result of these issues, IFC and the World Bank have developed this Off-Grid Market Opportunity Tool.</p>
                    <h2>How this tool can help</h2>
                    <ul>
